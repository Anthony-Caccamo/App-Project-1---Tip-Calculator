# App Project 1 - Tip Calculator

## :moneybag: Tippy :moneybag:

*Overview:*
Tippy is a command-line python app created by Anthony Caccamo in Python. It uses user-defined inputs to calculate the total bill (including tax and tip) and how much each person(s) should pay. This will save you a lot of hassle when going to dinner with friends and family. When the dreaded bill finally comes, use this app to quickly split the bill equally among everyone. It just may save your friendships.

What is required of the user is the following:
1. Total cost of the food (before taxes and tip).
2. The amount of people paying. This should be at least 1. If this was 0, then nothing would need to be paid. It is free!
3. The percent of tip you want to pay. Enter "20" for 20%, 5 for 5%, etc. 

With this information, Tippy will tell you the following:
1. The total bill, which includes tip and tax.
2. The amount each person should pay.

*WARNING:* Using this app at dinner with a significant other may lead to advsere consequences.

Thanks for using Tippy!
